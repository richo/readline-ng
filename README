Readline-NG is /not/ a drop in replacement for readline.

It addresses a very specific need I had inside a twitter client, but
hopefully it's of use to someone else, too.

It gives you an interface for a single input line underneath rows of scrolling
text. At the moment it's largely feature incomplete, and it's development tracks
twat pretty closely.

BUGS:

Control characters make it properly angry. Basically everything that's a result
of putting the terminal into raw mode

If you type over the end of the line, it bounces a new line which can't be
removed.

It doesn't handle left/right etc in the slightest. Non printable characters can
fuck the buffer.
